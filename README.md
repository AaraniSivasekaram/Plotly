# Belly Button Biodiversity
## Overview 
This challenge required knowledge of JavaScript functions to import data from a json file, use Plotly for web visualizations and execute formatting within html. 
The final product is an interactive webpage that provides analysis of volunteer samples of belly button bacteria, corresponding culture counts, and diversity is indicated through several graphs within the webpage. Webpage users may select any volunteer id and watch the interactive webpage update itself with each volunteer's information.
